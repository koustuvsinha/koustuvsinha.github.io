language models through the lens of systematicity, in order to assess their
human-level reasoning and comprehension of natural language. First, we
investigate the model&rsquo;s limits in encoding the natural language semantics by
proposing a diagnostic challenge dataset known as <a href=https://github.com/facebookresearch/clutrr>CLUTRR</a>. Drawing inspiration
from first-order logic, this dataset specifically tests for systematicity in
length generalization in natural language understanding models, in the form of a
question-answering task. We observe most major models fail in generalizing to
longer chain of reasoning, with the main limitation arising from their
rudimentary understanding of syntax. Next, we apply the principles of
systematicity to evaluate the syntax encoding strategy of large language models
by applying permutations to the word order seen during inference and training.
We observe a surprising fact that a trained neural language model can still
perform optimally when subjected to sentences of shuffled word orders, devoid of their original meaning, and furthermore they can even improve their performance
significantly on specific permutations. Next, we investigate the reasons of such
behavior by pre-training large language models on meaningless, word-order
shuffled corpora, to find they too behave optimally on downstream semantic and
syntactic tasks. These results highlight the potential distributional nature of large language models, such that they only focus on n-grams during computation. Finally, we attempt to investigate the root cause of these effects, to find the component of the model most responsible. We observe that certain classes of position embeddings lead the models to overfit on the token positions, subjecting models to exhibit un-systematic behavior on out-of-position sentences. In summary, this thesis attempts to shed more light to the black box nature of the state-of-the-art neural language models, and introduces mechanisms to test and ensure systematic behaviors in their understanding of natural language.</p><h2 id=thesis-document>Thesis Document</h2><p><a href=https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/jw827j238>McGill Archives</a></p><h2 id=papers-used-in-the-thesis>Papers used in the Thesis</h2><ul><li>Koustuv Sinha, Shagun Sodhani, Jin Dong, Joelle Pineau, and William L.
