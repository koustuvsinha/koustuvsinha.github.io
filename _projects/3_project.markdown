As a part of a broader [ConvAI](http://convai.io/) challenge, we, the Dialog Group
of McGill University under the supervision of [Dr Joelle Pineau](http://cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/), have trained a chatbot which can converse fluently with human judges with respect to a given
article. The articles are chosen from a broad corpus of [SQUAD dataset](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/), where topically
they vary from politics to sports to general news. The challenge is to have a fluent
conversation with the bot, centering around the topic of the article. Current system
uses an ensemble of Generative, Retrieval, and rule based models, and a decision agent
learned over actual human-bot responses to select the best candidate response at
a given time. We ranked third in the human evaluation round and currently competing in
the final round to be held alongside NIPS 2017. Our proposal was also recently awarded [ParlAI research grant](https://research.fb.com/announcing-the-winners-of-the-facebook-parlai-research-awards/) from Facebook.
