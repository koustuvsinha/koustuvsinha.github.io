abstract: 'Recently, there has been much interest in the question of whether deep
  natural language understanding models exhibit systematicity; generalizing such that
  units like words make consistent contributions to the meaning of the sentences in
  which they appear. There is accumulating evidence that neural models often generalize
  non-systematically. We examined the notion of systematicity from a linguistic perspective,
  defining a set of probes and a set of metrics to measure systematic behaviour. We
  also identified ways in which network architectures can generalize non-systematically,
  and discuss why such forms of generalization may be unsatisfying. As a case study,
  we performed a series of experiments in the setting of natural language inference
  (NLI), demonstrating that some NLU systems achieve high overall performance despite
  being non-systematic. '
