abstract: Deep neural networks have been displaying superior performance over traditional
  supervised classifiers in text classification. They learn to extract useful features
  automatically when sufficient amount of data is presented. However, along with the
  growth in the number of documents comes the increase in the number of categories,
  which often results in poor performance of the multiclass classifiers. In this work,
  we use external knowledge in the form of topic category taxonomies to aide the classification
  by introducing a deep hierarchical neural attention-based classifier. Our model
  performs better than or comparable to state-of-the-art hierarchical models at significantly
  lower computational cost while maintaining high interpretability.
