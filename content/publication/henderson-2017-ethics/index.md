abstract: 'The use of dialogue systems as a medium for human-machine interaction is
  an increasingly prevalent paradigm. A growing number of dialogue systems use conversation
  strategies that are learned from large datasets. There are well documented instances
  where interactions with these system have resulted in biased or even offensive conversations
  due to the data-driven training process. Here, we highlight potential ethical issues
  that arise in dialogue systems research, including: implicit biases in data-driven
  systems, the rise of adversarial examples, potential sources of privacy violations,
  safety concerns, special considerations for reinforcement learning systems, and
  reproducibility concerns. We also suggest areas stemming from these issues that
  deserve further investigation. Through this initial survey, we hope to spur research
  leading to robust, safe, and ethically sound dialogue systems.'
