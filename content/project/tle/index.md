_Minimalist connect-the-dots environment for RL agents!_

Turtle Learning Environment (TLE) is a minimalistic connect-the-dots environment made as part of COMP 767 RL Final project in McGill University (Winter 2018). The objective of the agent in a 28x28 grid world is to connect the dots provided to form the image, where the environment provides negative reward for each cell drawn and positive reward for each connected components.
