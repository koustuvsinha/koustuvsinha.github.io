abstract: Gender-bias stereotypes have recently raised significant ethical concerns
  in natural language processing. However, progress in the detection and evaluation
  of gender-bias in natural language understanding through inference is limited and
  requires further investigation. In this work, we propose an evaluation methodology
  to measure these biases by constructing a probe task that involves pairing a gender-neutral
  premise against a gender-specific hypothesis. We use our probe task to investigate
  state-of-the-art NLI models on the presence of gender stereotypes using occupations.
  Our findings suggest that three models (BERT, RoBERTa, and BART) trained on MNLI
  and SNLI data-sets are significantly prone to gender-induced prediction errors.
  We also find that debiasing techniques such as augmenting the training dataset to
  ensure that it is a gender-balanced dataset can help reduce such bias in certain
  cases.
