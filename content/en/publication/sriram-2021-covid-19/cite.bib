 abstract = {The rapid spread of COVID-19 cases in recent months has
strained hospital resources, making rapid and accurate triage
of patients presenting to emergency departments a necessity.
Machine learning techniques using clinical data such as chest
X-rays have been used to predict which patients are most at
risk of deterioration. We consider the task of predicting two
types of patient deterioration based on chest X-rays: adverse
event deterioration (i.e., transfer to the intensive care
unit, intubation, or mortality) and increased oxygen
requirements beyond 6 L per day. Due to the relative scarcity
of COVID-19 patient data, existing solutions leverage
supervised pretraining on related non-COVID images, but this
is limited by the differences between the pretraining data and
the target COVID-19 patient data. In this paper, we use
self-supervised learning based on the momentum contrast (MoCo)
method in the pretraining phase to learn more general image
representations to use for downstream tasks. We present three
results. The first is deterioration prediction from a single
image, where our model achieves an area under receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.742 for predicting
an adverse event within 96 hours (compared to 0.703 with
supervised pretraining) and an AUC of 0.765 for predicting
oxygen requirements greater than 6 L a day at 24 hours
(compared to 0.749 with supervised pretraining). We then
propose a new transformer-based architecture that can process
sequences of multiple images for prediction and show that this
model can achieve an improved AUC of 0.786 for predicting an
adverse event at 96 hours and an AUC of 0.848 for predicting
mortalities at 96 hours. A small pilot clinical study
suggested that the prediction accuracy of our model is
comparable to that of experienced radiologists analyzing the
same information.},
