abstract: 'Current conversational systems can follow simple commands and answer basic
  questions, but they have difficulty maintaining coherent and open-ended conversations
  about specific topics. Competitions like the Conversational Intelligence (ConvAI)
  challenge are being organized to push the research development towards that goal.
  This article presents in detail the RLLChatbot that participated in the 2017 ConvAI
  challenge. The goal of this research is to better understand how current deep learning
  and reinforcement learning tools can be used to build a robust yet flexible open
  domain conversational agent. We provide a thorough description of how a dialog system
  can be built and trained from mostly public-domain datasets using an ensemble model.
  The first contribution of this work is a detailed description and analysis of different
  text generation models in addition to novel message ranking and selection methods.
  Moreover, a new open-source conversational dataset is presented. Training on this
  data significantly improves the Recall@k score of the ranking and selection mechanisms
  compared to our baseline model responsible for selecting the message returned at
  each interaction. '
