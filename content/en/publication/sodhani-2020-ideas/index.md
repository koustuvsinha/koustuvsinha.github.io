abstract: 'This report documents ideas for improving the field of machine learning,
  which arose from discussions at the ML Retrospectives workshop at NeurIPS 2019.
  The goal of the report is to disseminate these ideas more broadly, and in turn encourage
  continuing discussion about how the field could improve along these axes. We focus
  on topics that were most discussed at the workshop: incentives for encouraging alternate
  forms of scholarship, re-structuring the review process, participation from academia
  and industry, and how we might better train computer scientists as scientists.'
