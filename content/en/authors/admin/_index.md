I'm a Research Scientist at [Meta AI](https://ai.meta.com/), in the Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) team. I received my PhD from [McGill University](http://mcgill.ca/) ([School of Computer Science](http://cs.mcgill.ca)) and [Mila (Quebec AI Institute)](https://mila.quebec), Montreal, Canada, where I was advised by Dr. [Joelle Pineau](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/). I also received by MSc (Thesis) from McGill University, where I was advised by Dr. [Derek Ruths](https://derekruths.com/) and Dr. Joelle Pineau.

My current research interest involves investigating the role of multimodal language models at understanding and reasoning the world through rich visual representations, especially by leveraging language as a tool to decode and reason the underlying physical rules governing the world.  My research also involves understanding the limits of [systematic](https://slideslive.com/38922304/from-system-1-deep-learning-to-system-2-deep-learning) language understanding - the ability of neural systems to understand language in a human-like way - by evaluating the extent of their capabilities in understanding semantics, syntax and generalizability.

I am also involved in improving and enabling reproducibile research in Machine Learning - I'm the lead organizer of the annual _Machine Learning Reproducibility Challenge_ ([V1](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ICLR2018-ReproducibilityChallenge.html), [V2](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ICLR2019-ReproducibilityChallenge.html), [V3](https://reproducibility-challenge.github.io/neurips2019/), [V4](https://paperswithcode.com/rc2020), [V5](https://paperswithcode.com/rc2021), [V6](https://paperswithcode.com/rc2022), [v7](https://reproml.org/)), and I serve as an associate editor at [ReScience C](http://rescience.github.io/), a peer reviewed journal promoting reproducible research. My work has been covered by several news outlets in the past, including [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03895-5), [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/15/facebook-claims-its-ai-can-anticipate-covid-19-outcomes-using-x-rays/), [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/03/facebook-covid-prognosis/), [DailyMail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-9153415/Facebook-claims-AI-predict-four-coronavirus-patients-condition-deteriorate.html) and [Hindustan Times](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tech/news/facebook-wants-to-help-doctors-fight-covid-19-with-ai-and-xrays-71611044405211.html).
