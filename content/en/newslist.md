-   [08/29/22] Excited to announce a major life event: I'm starting today as a Research Scientist (Speech &amp; NLP) in [Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/) New York!
-   [08/19/22] Happy to announce yet another Machine Learning Reproducibility Challenge, [the MLRC 2022](https://paperswithcode.com/rc2022)! This is our six edition!
-   [01/10/21] Happy to update that our paper ["Masked Language Modeling and the Distributional Hypothesis: Order Word Matters Pre-training for Little"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06644) is accepted as a long paper at EMNLP 2021!
-   [01/09/21] Happy to announce the new iteration of [ML Reproducibility Challenge 2021](https://paperswithcode.com/rc2021), which has now enlarged to cover 9 top ML conferences! Submit your reports through Feb 2022!
-   [03/07/21] On a personal news, got married to my sweetheart [Atrayee](https://atrayeebasu.github.io/) this July!
-   [02/07/21] Thrilled to share that our paper [UnNatural Language Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00010) has received **Outstanding Paper Award** at ACL 2021! Deeply honored!
-   [15/04/21] Announcing the pre-print of our paper ["Masked Language Modeling and the Distributional Hypothesis: Order Word Matters Pre-training for Little"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.06644). We find RoBERTa trained with sentence word order shuffled data performs remarkably close to natural word order pre-trained models on several downstream and probing tasks!
-   [01/06/21] Excited to announce that our paper ["UnNatural Language Inference"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00010), has been accepted to ACL 2021 (Long paper, Oral), where we stumble upon the weird language understanding mechanisms employed by NLU models!
-   [02/10/20] Happy to announce our paper ["Measuring Systematic Generalization in Neural Proof Generation with Transformers"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14786) is accepted at NeurIPS 2020!
-   [05/09/20] Excited to announce the [2020 edition of the ML Reproducibility Challenge](https://paperswithcode.com/rc2020)! We now cover 7 major ML conferences, do check it out!
