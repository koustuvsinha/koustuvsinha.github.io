My current research interest involves investigating the limits of [[https://slideslive.com/38922304/from-system-1-deep-learning-to-system-2-deep-learning][systematic]] language understanding of modern neural language representation systems, by leveraging linguistic and logical priors. In particular, I investigate how language is represented by neural models in a human-like way by testing their ability to understand the semantics, syntax and generalizability in the context of natural and artificial languages. I am also interested in improving the state of Generative Language Modeling (Dialog Systems).

A Diagnostic Benchmark for Inductive Reasoning from Text.

/Koustuv Sinha, Shagun Sodhani, Jin Dong, Joelle Pineau, William L. Hamilton/

*** Abstract

The recent success of natural language understanding (NLU) systems has been troubled by results highlighting the failure of these models to generalize in a systematic and robust way. In this work, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark suite, named CLUTRR, to clarify some key issues related to the robustness and systematicity of NLU systems. Motivated by classic work on inductive logic programming, CLUTRR requires that an NLU system infer kinship relations between characters in short stories. Successful performance on this task requires both extracting relationships between entities, as well as inferring the logical rules governing these relationships. CLUTRR allows us to precisely measure a model’s ability for systematic generalization by evaluating on held-out combinations of logical rules, and it allows us to evaluate a model’s robustness by adding curated noise facts. Our empirical results highlight a substantial performance gap between state-of-the-art NLU models (e.g., BERT and MAC) and a graph neural network model that works directly with symbolic inputs—with the graph-based model exhibiting both stronger generalization and greater robustness.

As a part of a broader [[http://convai.io/][ConvAI]] challenge, we, the
Dialog Group of McGill University under the supervision of
[[http://cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/][Dr Joelle Pineau]], have trained a
chatbot which can converse fluently with human judges with respect to a given article. The articles are chosen from a broad corpus of
[[https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/][SQUAD dataset]], where topically they vary from politics to sports to general news. The challenge is to have a fluent conversation with the bot, centering around the topic of the article. Current system uses an ensemble of Generative, Retrieval, and rule based models, and a decision agent learned over actual human-bot responses to select the best candidate response at a given time. We ranked third in the human evaluation round and ranked fourth in the final round held alongside NIPS 2017. Our proposal was also awarded

*Abstract*

Recent research has highlighted the role of relational inductive biases
in building learning agents that can generalize and reason in a
compositional manner. However, while relational learning algorithms such as graph neural networks (GNNs) show promise, we do not understand how effectively these approaches can adapt to new tasks. In this work, we
study the task of /logical generalization/ using GNNs by designing a
benchmark suite grounded in first-order logic. Our benchmark suite,
*=GraphLog=*, requires that learning algorithms perform rule induction
in different synthetic logics, represented as knowledge graphs.
*=GraphLog=* consists of relation prediction tasks on 57 distinct
logical domains. We use *=GraphLog=* to evaluate GNNs in three different
setups: single-task supervised learning, multi-task pretraining, and
continual learning. Unlike previous benchmarks, our approach allows us
to precisely control the logical relationship between the different
tasks. We find that the ability for models to generalize and adapt is
strongly determined by the diversity of the logical rules they encounter
during training, and our results highlight new challenges for the design
of GNN models.

*Abstract*

Recent investigations into the inner-workings of state-of-the-art
large-scale pre-trained Transformer-based Natural Language Understanding
(NLU) models indicate that they appear to understand human-like syntax,
at least to some extent. We provide novel evidence that complicates this
claim: we find that state-of-the-art Natural Language Inference (NLI)
models assign the same labels to permuted examples as they do to the
original, i.e. they are invariant to random word-order permutations.
This behavior notably differs from that of humans; we struggle to
understand the meaning of ungrammatical sentences. To measure the
severity of this issue, we propose a suite of metrics and investigate
which properties of particular permutations lead models to be word order
invariant. For example, in MNLI dataset we find almost all (98.7%)
examples contain at least one permutation which elicits the gold label.
Models are even able to assign gold labels to permutations that they
originally failed to predict correctly. We provide a comprehensive
empirical evaluation of this phenomenon, and further show that this
issue exists in pre-Transformer RNN / ConvNet based encoders, as well as
across multiple languages (English and Chinese). Our code and data are
available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/unlu.

*** Thesis Title

"Exploring the limits of systematicity of natural language understanding models"

*** Abstract

In this thesis, we investigate several approaches to evaluate modern neural
language models through the lens of systematicity, in order to assess their
human-level reasoning and comprehension of natural language. First, we
investigate the model's limits in encoding the natural language semantics by
proposing a diagnostic challenge dataset known as CLUTRR. Drawing inspiration
from first-order logic, this dataset specifically tests for systematicity in
length generalization in natural language understanding models, in the form of a
question-answering task. We observe most major models fail in generalizing to
longer chain of reasoning, with the main limitation arising from their
rudimentary understanding of syntax. Next, we apply the principles of
systematicity to evaluate the syntax encoding strategy of large language models
by applying permutations to the word order seen during inference and training.
We observe a surprising fact that a trained neural language model can still
perform optimally when subjected to sentences of shuffled word orders, devoid of their original meaning, and furthermore they can even improve their performance
significantly on specific permutations. Next, we investigate the reasons of such
behavior by pre-training large language models on meaningless, word-order
shuffled corpora, to find they too behave optimally on downstream semantic and
syntactic tasks. These results highlight the potential distributional nature of large language models, such that they only focus on n-grams during computation. Finally, we attempt to investigate the root cause of these effects, to find the component of the model most responsible. We observe that certain classes of position embeddings lead the models to overfit on the token positions, subjecting models to exhibit un-systematic behavior on out-of-position sentences. In summary, this thesis attempts to shed more light to the black box nature of the state-of-the-art neural language models, and introduces mechanisms to test and ensure systematic behaviors in their understanding of natural language.

*** Motivation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: motivation
:END:

Question Answering (QA) has recently gained popularity as the major
domain of testing reasoning in text. The literature thus contains a
[[https://nlpprogress.com/english/question_answering.html][deluge of Question Answering (QA) datasets]] to choose from. These datasets test
the system's ability to extract factual answers from the text. However,
there are growing concerns regarding the ability of Natural Language
Understanding (NLU) models to *generalize* - both in a /systematic/ and
/robust/ way. Adding to that, the recent dominance of large pre-trained
language models (such as BERT, [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805][Devlin et al. 2018]]) on many NLU
benchmarks including QA suggests that the primary difficulty in these
datasets are about incorporating the statistics of the language, or the
syntax of the language, rather than pure reasoning.

We want to develop systems which perform reasoning /inductively/,
i.e. not only by pure extraction of text facts but by performing a
higher-order reasoning and drawing conclusions based on /evidence/.
Ideally, we also want the systems to /generalize/ on unseen
distributions, as well as be /robust/ to adversarial attacks. To
facilitate that research, we present our diagnostic suite "=CLUTRR=".

*** Overview
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: overview
:END:
Our benchmark suite =CLUTRR= contains a large set of semi-synthetic
stories involving hypothetical families. Given a story, the goal is to
infer the relationship between two family members, whose relationship is
not explicitly mentioned.

[[file:images/clutrr_text.png]]

To solve this task, an agent must extract the /logical rules/ governing
the composition of the relationships (e.g. the transitivity of the
sibling relations). The benchmark allows us to test the learning agent's
ability for /systematic generalization/ by testing on stories that
contain unseen combinations of logical rules. It also allows us to
precisely test for the various forms of /model robustness/ by adding
different kinds of superfluous /noise facts/ to the stories.

*** Dataset Construction
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: dataset-construction
:END:
To derive a dataset which provides an effective way to test
generalization and robustness, we looked into classical Logic.
[[https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~shm/ilp.html][Inductive Logic Programming]]
(ILP) is a vast field of work which tries to solve the exact problem of
inductively inferring rules from a given set of data, and one of the
classical examples in the field is deducing kinship relations. For
example, given the facts:

- /"Alice is Bob's mother"/
- /"Jim is Alice's father"/

one can infer with reasonable certainty that:

- /"Jim is Bob's grandfather"/

While this may appear trivial to us, it is a challenging task to design
models that can learn from the data to /induce/ the logical rules
necessary to make such inferences. For the above example, the system
needs to learn the rule:

\[
[\texttt{grandfatherOf},X,Y] \vdash [[\texttt{fatherOf},X,Z], [\texttt{fatherOf}, Z,Y]]
\]

In ILP, a subset of the above rules was provided as /background
knowledge/ to the system. The system then used to generate higher-order
of rules by recombining existing rules and validating it with the given
data.

Inspired by this classic task, we set upon building a QA task where
/each story is grounded with a logical rule/. The core idea being that
each story would describe a set of natural language relations, and the
target is to infer the relationship between two entities whose
relationship *is not explicitly stated* in the story.

To generate such a story, we first design a knowledge base (KB) of valid
relation compositions for the kinship world. In practice, we used a set
of [[https://github.com/facebookresearch/clutrr/blob/master/clutrr/store/rules_store.yaml][15 simple rules]] by carefully avoiding possible ambiguities (such as
relations derived from in-laws). Using these set of rules, we generate
the underlying /kinship graph/, i.e. a graph containing the kinship
relations about a toy family.

[[file:images/dataset_const_new.png]]

From this kinship graph, we sample an /edge/ which becomes our target
relation to predict. Recall, since we used /logical rules/ to derive
this graph, a path or walk in the graph from a source to sink
constitutes a valid logical rule or /clause/. We simply sample such a
path of length $k$, where $k$ is the tunable parameter for the
data generation.

*** Adding Language
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: adding-language
:END:
Given this sampled path $G_p$, we aim to convert this into
/semi-synthetic/ text. The naive way would be to just replace each edge
in the path by a placeholder text explaining the relationship between
them. Consider the example provided in the above figure. The path
\[ B \rightarrow A \rightarrow D \rightarrow G \] can be replaced by the
following text:

- \[ B \rightarrow A \] : B is the wife of A
- \[ A \rightarrow D \] : D is the daughter of A
- \[ D \rightarrow G \] : D is the mother of G

However, as you can see it already, this ends up to a very artificial
dataset having less linguistic variation. Thus, to reduce the artificial
flavor, we asked [[https://parl.ai/docs/tutorial_mturk.html][Amazon
Mechanical Turkers]] to provide us paraphrases for entire sampled paths.
The above example then converts to:

#+begin_quote
A went to shopping with her wife B at the local grocery store. His
daughter, D, is visiting them for thanksgiving with her daughter G.

#+end_quote

This adds extra levels of complexity in the task : co-reference
resolution, dependency parsing and named entity recognition.

In practice, it became difficult to collect paraphrases of /all/
possible paths of unbounded lengths. Turkers need active attention to
paraphrase each path, and futhermore increasing path length increases
the number of combinations of relations, leading to larger and larger
number of unique paths. Thus, we collected paraphrases for all possible
combinations till $k=3$, and we *re-use* paraphrases to stitch
together a story. We collect 6,016 unique paraphrases with an average of
19 paraphrases for every possible logical clause of length
$k = 1,2,3$.

[[file:images/composition.png]]

From the above example, we see that the stochasticity of dataset
generation provides multiple ways of stitching paraphrases to generate
stories. While the topicality of different paraphrases might impact
coherence of the story, the stitched story remains logically grounded
with respect to kinship relations, and maintains the aspects of
co-reference resolution.

*** Question & Task
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: question-task
:END:
Thus, given a logically grounded story $S$ , the question simply boils down to the /target edge/, i.e. the source and sink. We refrained
from using a "natural language" question following the insightful
discoveries of [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.04926][Kaushik & Lipton,
(EMNLP 2018)]], thus our question is a tuple of entities, where the
order defines the exact kinship relation. Finally, the task is to
classify the correct relation among 22 kinship relations.

*** Systematic Generalization
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: systematic-generalization
:END:
Systematic Generalization is the ability of a model to solve tasks on a
test distribution which is different than the training distribution,
while the test distribution has been derived from the same /production
rules/ as that of the training.
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_Structures][Chomsky (1957)]],
[[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1755-2567.1970.tb00434.x][Montague
(1970)]], [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00350][Lake & Baroni (2018)]]
define the term as:

#+begin_quote
The algebraic capacity to understand and produce a potentially infinite
number of novel combinations from known components.

#+end_quote

This topic is [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12889][so involved]] it
requires a separate blog post on its own. In simple terms, we want our
NLU models to generalize on out-of-domain data distributions in a
particular task. However, restricting the scope of out-of-domain is
critical : we cannot expect a model trained on sentence entailments in
English to generalize on Bengali for instance.

In our dataset, we provide a simple way to test out-of-domain (OOD)
generalization : by evaluating on stories with different logical
compositions of the relations. To understand the composition of a single
relation, the model needs to learn all binary compositions which lead to
the particular relation. (e.g. /father + father = grandfather/, and
/sibling + grandfather = grandfather/). Once it does, the model should
be able to generalize on unseen compositions by *re-using the learnt
composition functions*. The test distribution is still derived from the
same /production rules/, as in the same knowledge base (KB).

OOD Generalization can be also be achieved in the level of the
underlying language in our dataset. Recall, we have used a set of
placeholders collected from AMT to construct the stories : we can thus
have a subset of the collected paraphrases being /held out/ for testing.
This enables /linguistic generalization/, which explicitly restricts
models to /memorize/ on syntactical artifacts of the dataset.

[[file:images/sys_gen_23.png]]
[[file:images/sys_gen_234.png]]

We perform experiments with a combination of logical and linguistic
generalization with two types of baselines : NLU models such as BiLSTM,
Relation Networks ([[https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01427][Santoro et al,
2017]]), MAC ([[https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03067][Hudson et al, 2018]]),
and pretrained language model such as BERT
([[https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805][Devlin et al. 2018]]); and Graph
Attention Networks (GAT) ([[https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903][Veličković
et al, 2018]]) working on the symbolic graphs underlying the stories. We
observe that Systematic Generalization is a hard problem with
performance decrease across all models as we increase the length of the
logical clause $k$. This highlights the challenge of "zero-shot"
systematic generalization ([[https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.00350][Lake &
Baroni, 2018]]; [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07017][Sodhani et
al. 2018]]). The performance of GAT is significantly better than all NLU
baselines, indicating that most NLU systems focus on the syntax rather
than abstract reasoning.

*** Robust Reasoning
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: robust-reasoning
:END:
The modular setup of =CLUTRR= allows us to diagnose models for
*robustness*, another critical form of generalization. Since all
underlying stories have a logically valid path $G_p$, we can add
paths which are not relevant to resolution of the task. Concretely, we
can add three types of /noise/:

- /Supporting facts/: A path which originates and ends within $G_p$.
  These are /extra facts/ which are not needed to answer the query, but
  can be used, in principle, to construct alternative reasoning paths.
- /Irrelevant facts/: A dangling path which originates from $G_p$
  but has a different sink. This is essentially a distractor which the
  model has to carefully stray away while reasoning for the given query.
- /Disconnected facts/: A path which neither originates nor ends in
  $G_p$. This constitute an unrelated noise in the data.

[[file:images/clutrr_noise.png]]

Thus, we can have multiple train/test scenarios to evaluate robustness
in highly granular level by combination of the above facts with the
clean setup. We perform experiments with the same set of baselines while
fixing the length $k$ of the clauses to $(2,3)$. We observe that
overall GAT outperforms NLU models significantly on a range of
train/test scenarios. This showcases the benefit of structure and
inductive bias for performing abstract reasoning.

We observe a couple of interesting trends as well:

- NLU models perform better when testing on supporting and irrelevant
  facts while being trained on a noise-less setup. This suggests NLU
  models actually benefit from /more content/ which may provide
  linguistic cues, irrelevant of the reasoning pathway.
- GAT model performs poorly on the above setup which shows that it is
  sensitive to changes involving cycles - it cannot understand the need
  of cycles of they are not trained with one. However, GAT performs
  significantly better when trained with cycles.

*** Key Takeaways
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: key-takeaways
:END:
- We need structure / inductive biases in our models to perform better
  on Generalization and Robust Reasoning
- NLU models must try to represent the inductive bias or structure
  internally
- Systematic Generalization is hard, and we need more research in
  representing compositional and modular networks.
- Logic provides a provable way to devise datasets for tasks involving
  abstract reasoning

*** Closing Remarks
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: closing-remarks
:END:
=CLUTRR= provides a fine-grained modular way to test the reasoning
capabilities of NLU systems - by asking the fundamental questions of
Systematic Generalization and Robustness. We found that existing NLU
systems perform relatively poorly on these questions compared to a
graph-based model which has symbolic inputs. This highlights the gap
that remains between machine reasoning models that work on unstructured
text and structured inputs.

*** Motivation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: motivation
:END:
A question that we are highly interested in finding an answer to is /how
generalizable our learning algorithms are/? Human beings
[[https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0097-7403.24.4.405][are
incredibly good]] at generalization - even at old age, we can /learn/
new concepts and /apply/ them in practice. Critical steps towards
building algorithms that [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00289][think like
human beings]] include /Multitask Learning/ - the ability to learn
multiple concepts at once; and /Continual Learning/ - the ability to
accumulate new knowledge without forgetting the previous knowledge.

Defining a task that aims at either Multitask Learning or Continual
learning is challenging - the task should accurately quantify the
/"distribution shift"/ in the data. Having precise control of this shift
could allow us to understand the drawbacks of our learning methods, and
build systems which can generalize over multiple tasks but still
remember the old ones.

Data distributions can be quantified by generating them based on a
/grammar/. First-order logic, even with its basic use-case and
restrictions, can be an excellent tool for defining such generalizable
distributions - to test how systematic a model is. In our prior work, we
leveraged first-order logic to build the
[[https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~ksinha4/clutrr/][CLUTRR]] dataset, which
provides a kinship-relation game in natural language QA setting. A nice
property of =CLUTRR= is that it is designed to be a dynamic dataset -
one can always roll out longer kinship relation trees to stress-test the
generalizability of their proposed approach. Since it is designed to be
diagnostic, it opens up the possibility of investigating the semantic
understanding capability of Natural Language Understanding models under
[[https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~ksinha4/introducing-clutrr/][microscopic
precision]].

While CLUTRR primarily investigates the aspect of /length
generalization/, the core semantic rules driving the kinship relations
are static. In a real-world scenario, a model may have to /adapt/ to the
change in underlying dynamics of the domain (for example, recommender
systems trained on one domain being deployed / finetuned on a new
domain). In terms of grammar, two domains sharing the same grammar
constitute similar domains. We need a task where we can generalize over
different grammars and control the amount of distribution shift.

*** Introducing GraphLog
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: introducing-graphlog
:END:
In this work, we introduce a new paradigm of testing domain
generalization in graph-structure data, named *=GraphLog=*. Instead of
being a single dataset, *=GraphLog=* v1.0 contains 57 datasets, which
have their own set of grammar or generation rules.

*The Task* : We are primarily interested in /relation prediction/, where
given a graph $g_i$, a source node $v_i$, and sink node $v_j$, the
task is to predict the /type/ of the edge $r$ between $(v_i, v_j)$.
In Graph Neural Network (GNN) world, this task is typically performed by
[[https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06103][RGCN]] model on popular relation
prediction datasets.

[[file:images/graphlog.png]]

Graphs in *=GraphLog=* are generated using /rules/ in first-order logic.
These rules are 2-ary Horn clauses in the form of
$[r_i, r_j] \rightarrow r_j$, where $r_i$ are the /types/ of
relation. Each /world/ is a dataset on its own, which consists of 5000
graphs procedurally generated by their own set of rules, which
themselves are generated stochastically. Between multiple worlds, there
can be overlap between the rules, which helps us in explicitly
quantifying the shift in the data distribution. This enables us to
perform Multi-task learning and Continual learning along with supervised
learning experiments in graph-structured data, which is one of the first
datasets which propose to do so.

*** Supervised Learning
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: supervised-learning
:END:
*=GraphLog=* can be used to perform supervised relation prediction tasks
in any of its multiple worlds. Due to the stochastic nature of rule
generation, certain worlds are more /difficult/ than others. We define
the notion of difficulty empirically based on model performance, but we
observe a correlation with the number of /descriptors/ or unique /walks/
in the graphs associated with a world.

[[file:images/graphlog_supervised.png]]

[[file:images/graphlog_multitask.png]]

*** Multi-task Learning
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: multi-task-learning
:END:
*=GraphLog=* makes it easy to extend the supervised learning framework
for multi-task learning by transferring model parameters on the next
task. We find the model's capacity saturates at 20 tasks, however we
hypothesize larger capacity with more data points will increase the
number of tasks. We use a two-step model that adapts for relations in
different worlds, the details of which can be
[[https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06560][found in our paper]].

*** Continual Learning
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: continual-learning
:END:
*=GraphLog=* enables us to evaluate the generalization capability of
graph neural networks in the sequential continual learning setup where
the model is trained on a sequence of worlds. Before training on a new
world, the model is evaluated on all the worlds that the model has
trained on so far. We observe that as the model is trained on different
worlds, it performance on the previous worlds degrades rapidly. This
observation highlights that the current reasoning models are not
suitable for continual learning.

A recurrent challenge in machine learning research is to ensure that the
presented and published results are reliable, robust, and reproducible
[[[http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/bouthillier19a.html][4]],[[https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10337][5]],[[https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06560][6]],[[https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06674][7]]].

Reproducibility, obtaining similar results as presented in a paper using
the same code and data, is necessary to verify the reliability of
research findings. Reproducibility is also an important step to promote
open and accessible research, thereby allowing the scientific community
to quickly integrate new findings and convert ideas to practice.
Reproducibility also promotes the use of robust experimental workflows,
which potentially reduce unintentional errors.

In this blog post, we will share commonly used tools and explain 12
basic practices that you can use in your research to ensure reproducible
science.

*** Practices
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: practices
:END:
**** 1. Config Management
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: config-management
:END:
When you begin implementing your research code, the first line of work
is to define an argument parser to define the set of parameters your
code expects. These set of hyperparameters can typically look like this:

#+begin_src sh
python train.py --hidden_dim 100 --batch_size 32 --num_tasks 10 --dropout 0.2 --with_mask --log_interval 100 --learning_rate 0.001 --optimizer sgd --scheduler plateau --scheduler_gamma 0.9 --weight_decay 0.9
#+end_src

These sets of arguments typically grow over time in your research
project, making maintenance and reproducibility a pain. Typically in
your code, you should be careful to log all hyperparameters for all
experiments, so that you can replicate an old version of your code.
[[https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning][Pytorch
Lightning]] provides a great way to log all hyperparameters in =.csv=
files in the experiment output folder, allowing for better
reproducibility.

An alternative to using a long list of argparse elements is to use
config files. Config files can be either in JSON or YAML format (I
prefer YAML due to the ability to add comments), where you can set your
hyperparams in a logically nested way. The above set of hyperparams
could be organized as:

#+begin_src yaml
# config.yaml
general: # for generic args
  batch_size: 32
  num_tasks: 10
  with_mask: False
  log_interval: 100
optim: # for optimizer args
  learning_rate: 0.001
  optimizer: sgd
  scheduler: plateau
  scheduler_gamma: 0.9
  weight_decay: 0.9
model:
  hidden_dim: 100
#+end_src

[[https://github.com/omry/omegaconf][OmegaConf]] (part of
[[https://hydra.cc][Hydra]]) is a great library that allows you to
maintain these config files while providing added flexibility to import
previous config files and modify only a few values.

**** 2. Checkpoint Management
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: checkpoint-management
:END:
Managing your model checkpoints is very important in terms of
reproducibility, as it allows you to release trained models for the
community to easily verify your work, as well as build upon it. Ideally,
you should save your checkpoints as frequently as possible. Given the
system resource restrictions, it is usually not feasible. Thus, it is
ideal to save the last checkpoint along with the checkpoint of the /last
best model/ (according to your evaluation metrics).
[[https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning][Pytorch
Lightning]] provides an in-built solution to do this efficiently.

**** 3. Logging
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: logging
:END:
When training your model, you realize that for several parameters it is
not giving you the ideal performance. Ideally, you want to check several
things. Is the training loss of the model saturating? Is it still going
down? How is the validation performance over training look like? You
need to log all the metrics efficiently, and later plot those metrics in
nice shiny plots for analysis and inspection.

Logging is also important for reproducibility, so researchers can verify
the training progression of their replications in great detail.

In the bare-bones setup, you could just log all metrics in the
filesystem and then plot by loading them in a python script using
matplotlib. To make this process easy and also to provide live,
interactive plots, several services are available now which you can
leverage in your work.
[[https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard][Tensorboard]], for example, is
popular in the ML community primarily for its early adoption and ability
to deploy locally. Newer entrants, like
[[https://www.comet.ml/site/][Comet.ML]],
[[https://www.wandb.com/][WandB]] or [[https://mlflow.org/][MLFlow]],
provide exciting features ranging from sharable online logging
interfaces, with fine-grained ability to monitor experiments and
hyperparams. In a future blog post, we will discuss on the pros and cons
of these systems.

**** 4. Setting the seed
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: setting-the-seed
:END:
Probably the most important aspect of the exact reproducibility of your
research is the seed of the experiment. Although exact reproducibility
is not guaranteed, especially in GPU execution environments
[[[https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/cudnn-developer-guide/index.html#reproducibility][2]],
[[https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/randomness.html][8]]], it's
still beneficial to report the seed due to its impact on your results.

When you begin your experiments, it suggested to first set the seed
using scripts like these (assuming if you use PyTorch):

#+begin_src python
def set_seed(seed):
    """Set seed"""
    random.seed(seed)
    np.random.seed(seed)
    torch.manual_seed(seed)
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        torch.cuda.manual_seed(seed)
        torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(seed)
        torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True
        torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False
    os.environ["PYTHONHASHSEED"] = str(seed)
#+end_src

*Do not optimize the seed like a hyperparameter. If your algorithm only
works on a range of seeds, it's not a robust contribution.*

Reporting the performance of your model on /multiple seeds/ captures the
variance of the proposed model. Before beginning your experiments,
randomly draw \(n\) seeds and set them aside in your config file, and
report all experimental results aggregated over those \(n\) seeds.
\(n=5\) is a good starting point, but you an always increase this
number.

**** 5. Version Control
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: version-control
:END:
To track your research effectively, we highly recommended practice
setting up version control using =git= in your repository from the
get-go. You can use a service like [[https://github.com][Github]] or
[[https://gitlab.com/][Gitlab]] as your hosting provider.

Use =git commit=s to explain to your future self (and your
collaborators) what change you made to your experiment at a given time.
Ideally, you should /always commit before you run an experiment/, so
that you can =tag= the results with specific commits. Be as detailed
with your commit messages as you can - your future self will thank you!

Check out the
[[https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/commit/9996f697e3ed7a0d6fe4348953723ad6b9d51477][commits]]
from
[[https://github.com/huggingface/transformers][Huggingface/transformers]]
repository for a nice example.

**** 6. Data Management
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: data-management
:END:
Managing your data is extremely important for reproducibility,
especially when you propose a new dataset or a new dataset split. In
your many rounds of experiments, you would probably work with different
splits of the data, hence tracking all those changes should have similar
priority as tracking your code.

The easiest way to track your data is to add it to the git version
system or use cloud storage solutions such as Google Drive, AWS S3 to
store your datasets.

For large datasets, you can also use
[[https://git-lfs.github.com/][=git-lfs=]], or maintain a md5 hash of
the dataset in your config file, like this:

#+begin_src python
def md5_update_from_dir(directory: Union[str, Path], hash: Hash) -> Hash:
    assert Path(directory).is_dir()
    for path in sorted(Path(directory).iterdir(), key=lambda p: str(p).lower()):
        hash.update(path.name.encode())
        if path.is_file():
            hash = md5_update_from_file(path, hash)
        elif path.is_dir():
            hash = md5_update_from_dir(path, hash)
    return hash


def md5_dir(directory: Union[str, Path]) -> str:
    return str(md5_update_from_dir(directory, hashlib.md5()).hexdigest())
#+end_src

[[https://stackoverflow.com/a/54477583][Source - StackOverflow]]

Having such a hash will allow you to track which dataset or data split
you were working on at a certain commit.

**** 7. Data Analysis
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: data-analysis
:END:
Keeping track of the analysis you perform on the data/results is also
very important in terms of the reproducibility of your contribution.
[[https://jupyter.org][Jupyter Notebooks]] are the standard in
maintaining all your analysis and plotting functions in one place.
Ideally, you should separate notebooks for data analysis, result
analysis, plot generation, and table generation, and add them in your
version control. Pandas'
[[https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_latex.html][to_latex]]
allows you to directly write your results as a latex table, removing
error-prone copying of results into LaTeX.

When you need to update the results in your paper, you can just access
the corresponding file and re-run the cells. You can also parameterize
and run notebooks with the
[[https://github.com/nteract/papermill#execute-via-the-python-api][papermill
API]] so that your notebooks are cleanly executed your desired analysis
parameters.

Maintaining Jupyter Notebooks can get tricky over time. Consider
following the best practices [[[https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08055][1]]]
and use
[[https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions][Jupter
contrib nbextensions]] to supercharge your notebooks!

**** 8. Reporting Results
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: reporting-results
:END:
When reporting your results, it is ideal to run your experiments in
different seeds and/or different datasets. Thus, your results should
contain plots with error bars and tables with standard deviations. You
should also describe how the descriptive statistics were calculated,
e.g. mean reward over multiple seeds. Statistical testing and
highlighting statistically significant values is also encouraged
[[[https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10922][9]]]. This information provides a
more realistic assessment of the performance of a model and avoids the
sharing of overly optimistic results
[[[http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/bouthillier19a.html][4]],[[https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.10337][5]],[[https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06560][6]],[[https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06674][7]]].

A higher bar of reproducibility is to report the results on /multiple
datasets/ to highlight the robustness of your model. Even if the model
has larger variance over different datasets, its still encouraged to
report them all - to avoid the discovery of these issues later on.

While reporting your results, consult the
[[https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ReproducibilityChecklist.pdf][ML
Reproducibility Checklist]] which has detailed guidelines on the best
practices for reporting figures and tables.

**** 9. Managing Dependencies
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: managing-dependencies
:END:
Irreproducibility often stems from software deprecation. To replicate a
published work, the first thing to do is to match the same development
environment, containing the same libraries that the program expects.
Thus, it is crucial to document the libraries and their versions that
you use in your experiments. After your experiments are stable, you can
leverage =pip= or =conda= to collect all libraries that have been used:

#+begin_src sh
$ pip freeze > requirements.txt
$ conda env export > environment.yml
#+end_src

You can also leverage headless virtual machines such as
[[https://www.docker.com/][Docker]] or
[[https://sylabs.io/docs/][Singularity]] to provide the exact
reproducible dev environment used for the experiments. Singularity, in
particular, is supported in many HPC systems (such as
[[https://www.computecanada.ca/][Compute Canada]]), which can be used to
train and then subsequently release your experiments to the public. You
can also convert your existing repository into a Docker environment
using [[https://github.com/jupyter/repo2docker][repo2docker]].

**** 10. Open Source Release
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: open-source-release
:END:
After you have published your paper, consider open sourcing your
experiments. This not only encourages reproducible research but also
adds more visibility to your paper. Once you release your code, consider
adding it to [[https://paperswithcode.com/][Papers With Code]] for added
visibility. You can also release a demo on
[[https://mybinder.org][Binder]] or
[[https://colab.research.google.com/][Colab]] to encourage people to use
your model.

For good examples of model demos check out
[[[https://distill.pub/2018/differentiable-parameterizations/][10]]].

Before releasing your code, check the following:

- Squash the commits in the public branch (master) into a single commit
  - Helps remove your private experiment commit messages (and the
    awkward comments!)
- Make sure your code does not contain any API keys (for loggers such as
  WandB or Comet.ML)
- Keep an eye out for hardcoded file paths
- Improve readability of your code using formatters such as
  [[https://pypi.org/project/black/][Black]]. Obscure, poorly written
  codebases, even when they run, are oftentimes impossible to reuse or
  build on top of
- Document your functions and classes appropriately. In ML, it's
  beneficial to the reader if you annotate your code with input and
  output tensor dimensions.

**** 11. Effective Communication
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: effective-communication
:END:
When releasing your code, try to add as much information about the code
in the README file. [[https://paperswithcode.com/][Papers With Code]]
released
[[https://medium.com/paperswithcode/ml-code-completeness-checklist-e9127b168501][ML
Code Completeness checklist]], which suggests adding the following in
your README:

- Dependency information
- Training scripts
- Evaluation scripts
- Pre-trained models
- Results

[[https://paperswithcode.com/][Papers With Code]] evaluated repositories
released after NeurIPS 2019 and found repositories that do not address
any of the above only got a median of 1.5 Github stars, whereas
repositories which have all five of the above criteria got *196.5*
median stars! Only 9% of the repositories fulfilled the 5 points, so
definitely we can do better about communicating our research. The better
the communication, the better it is in terms of reproducibility.

You should always mention clearly the source of the dataset used in the
work. If you are releasing a new dataset or pretrained model for the
community, consider adding proper documentation for easy access, such as
a [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010][datasheet]] or
[[https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993][model card]]. These are READMEs for
the dataset or model which contains:

- Motivation
- Composition
- Collection Process
- Preprocessing
- Use cases
- Distribution
- Maintenance

Read the papers [[[https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010][3]],
[[https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993][11]]] for more details on these
questions and how to address them. You can choose to publish your
dataset either through Github repository or through
[[https://zenodo.org/][Zenodo]].

**** 12. Test and Validate
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: test-and-validate
:END:
Finally, it's important from the reproducibility perspective to test
your implementation in a /different environment/ than the training
setup. This testing doesn't necessarily mean you have to re-train the
entire pipeline. Specifically, you should make sure that the training
and evaluation scripts are running in the test environment.

To get an isolated test environment, you can use AWS or GCP cloud
instances. You can also checkout [[https://codeocean.com/][CodeOcean]]
which provides isolated AWS instances tied to Jupyter Notebooks for easy
evaluation.

*** Final Thoughts
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: final-thoughts
:END:
Reproducibility is hard. Maintaining a reproducible research codebase is
harder when the incentive is to publish your ideas quicker than your
competitor. Nevertheless, we agree with what Joelle Pineau said in
NeurIPS 2018 :
[[https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=2120856364798049&ref=watch_permalink][/"Science
is not a competitive sport"/]]. We need to invest more time and care in
our research, and we need to ensure as computer scientists our work is
reproducible so that it adds value to the reader and practitioners who
would build upon our work.

We hope this post will be useful in your research. Feel free to comment
if you have any particular point/libraries that we missed, we would be
happy to add them.

Over the last couple of years I have steadily transferred most of my workflows in Emacs (more specifically, Doom Emacs). As they truly say, Emacs is not just an editor, it is an operating system. I think Emacs is not for everyone. It has a very steep learning curve, especially with understanding a new language (elisp) for configuration. Having said that, once you learn how to use Emacs, you unlock insane levels of productivity. It is customizable beyond expectation, and allows one to "live" within Emacs for most of their daily needs. Emacs has helped me streamline my paper reading habits, which I'll talk in detail in this post. Specifically, I use the following tools from the Emacs ecosystem: [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-Mode]], [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][Elfeed]], [[https://github.com/sp1ff/elfeed-score][Elfeed-score]], [[https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex][Helm-Bibtex]] and [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][Org-ref]].

[[file:images/elfeed_main.png]]

*** Discovering papers: Elfeed

[[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][Elfeed]] is a very versatile RSS reader for Emacs. Turns out you can use Elfeed to subscribe to Arxiv feeds as well. Do check [[https://cundy.me/post/elfeed/][Chris Cundy's post]] on this topic, where he introduces the concepts of Elfeed and Elfeed-score. Following the setup of Chris, I setup Elfeed to read Arxiv Atom posts in the stat.ML, cs.LG and cs.CL categories, which I typically follow anyways for new papers in NLP and ML.

**** The Basics

Setting up these Atom feeds in Elfeed is trivial.

#+begin_src elisp

(setq elfeed-feeds '("http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=cat:stat.ML&start=0&max_results=100&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=descending" "http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=cat:cs.LG&start=0&max_results=100&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=descending" "http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=cat:cs.CL&start=0&max_results=100&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=descending"))
#+end_src

The =elfeed-feeds= variable consists of a list of strings with the export URLs. Notice in these URL's the max_results are set to 100, feel free to modify it if you want to fetch older entries.

The default Elfeed homepage is not that useful for reading arxiv papers as it truncates the titles. Chris provides a nice solution to show the title and authors list truncated by an "et. al" in the main Elfeed view.

#+begin_src elisp
(defun concatenate-authors (authors-list)
    "Given AUTHORS-LIST, list of plists; return string of all authors concatenated."
    (if (> (length authors-list) 1)
        (format "%s et al." (plist-get (nth 0 authors-list) :name))
      (plist-get (nth 0 authors-list) :name)))

(defun my-search-print-fn (entry)
    "Print ENTRY to the buffer."
    (let* ((date (elfeed-search-format-date (elfeed-entry-date entry)))
        (title (or (elfeed-meta entry :title)
                    (elfeed-entry-title entry) ""))
        (title-faces (elfeed-search--faces (elfeed-entry-tags entry)))
        (entry-authors (concatenate-authors
                        (elfeed-meta entry :authors)))
        (title-width (- (window-width) 10
                        elfeed-search-trailing-width))
        (title-column (elfeed-format-column
                        title 100
                        :left))
        (entry-score (elfeed-format-column (number-to-string (elfeed-score-scoring-get-score-from-entry entry)) 10 :left))
        (authors-column (elfeed-format-column entry-authors 40 :left)))
    (insert (propertize date 'face 'elfeed-search-date-face) " ")

    (insert (propertize title-column
                        'face title-faces 'kbd-help title) " ")
    (insert (propertize authors-column
                        'kbd-help entry-authors) " ")
    (insert entry-score " ")))

(setq elfeed-search-print-entry-function #'my-search-print-fn)
(setq elfeed-search-date-format '("%y-%m-%d" 10 :left))
(setq elfeed-search-title-max-width 110)
#+end_src

Then, set the default filter to show unread papers from 2 weeks ago. This is also customizable.

#+begin_src elisp
(setq elfeed-search-filter "@2-week-ago +unread")
#+end_src

We would also like to instruct Elfeed to /fetch/ the papers whenever we open the Elfeed interface:

#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook! 'elfeed-search-mode-hook 'elfeed-update)
#+end_src

**** Scoring papers

As you may have noticed, =my-search-print-fn= contains the function =elfeed-score-scoring-get-score-from-entry= call, which uses [[https://github.com/sp1ff/elfeed-score][Elfeed-score]] package to score individual papers. [[https://github.com/sp1ff/elfeed-score][Elfeed-score]] is a simple but effective utility to allow you to set regex filter rules to score papers based on the relevance of your research area.

Install elfeed-score package using =use-package=, and then set the location of the rules file.

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package! elfeed-score
  :after elfeed
  :config
  (elfeed-score-load-score-file "~/.doom.d/elfeed.score") ; See the elfeed-score documentation for the score file syntax
  (elfeed-score-enable)
  (define-key elfeed-search-mode-map "=" elfeed-score-map))
#+end_src

Now go ahead and create the file =elfeed.score= in your location of choice. This file basically contains the rules written in elisp. For example, my rule set after a couple of days usage is this:

#+begin_src elisp
;;; Elfeed score file                                     -*- lisp -*-
((version 10)
 ("title"
  (:text "Transformer" :value 10 :type s)
  (:text "Summarization" :value -50 :type s))
 ("content")
 ("title-or-content"
  (:text "Gender Bias" :title-value 50 :content-value 50 :type s)
  (:text "BERT" :title-value 100 :content-value 50 :type S)
  (:text "Generalization" :title-value 30 :content-value 20 :type s)
  (:text "out-of-distribution" :title-value 20 :content-value 30 :type s)
  (:text "language model" :title-value 20 :content-value 30 :type s))
 ("tag")
 ("authors"
  (:text "Percy Liang" :value 200 :type w)
  (:text "Sebastian Ruder" :value 200 :type w))
 ("feed")
 ("link")
 ("udf")
 (mark nil)
 ("adjust-tags"))
#+end_src

This score file thus pushes the papers we would like to read up to the top:

[[file:images/elfeed_score.png]]



*** Managing papers: Org-ref and Org-mode

When I'm reading the abstract of an interesting paper in Elfeed, if I want to read the pdf I can simply press =Shift+RET= to open the pdf in my browser. However, that doesn't offer a way to store the pdf files, neither does it offer a way to open the pdf in emacs. I want a system which can allow me to:

1. Store the pdf in a folder
2. Add a bibtex entry to a centralized bib file with the paper information
3. Keep track of papers I have read, along with notes

**** Store the pdfs from Elfeed

I initially started my configuration following the nice talk by Ahmed in [[https://emacsconf.org/2021/talks/research/][EmacsConf 2021]] (I highly recommend watching it!). Ahmed also provides a nice [[https://gist.github.com/rka97/57779810d3664f41b0ed68a855fcab54][gist for starters]], which I used to construct the basic function to perform steps 1 and 2.

#+begin_src elisp
(setq arxiv_bib "~/org/arxiv.bib")
(setq arxiv_pdf_loc "~/Documents/arxiv/")

(defun my/elfeed-entry-to-arxiv ()
    "Fetch an arXiv paper into the local library from the current elfeed entry.
"
    (interactive)
    (let* ((link (elfeed-entry-link elfeed-show-entry))
           (match-idx (string-match "arxiv.org/abs/\\([0-9.]*\\)" link))
           (matched-arxiv-number (match-string 1 link)))
      (when matched-arxiv-number
        (message "Going to arXiv: %s" matched-arxiv-number)
        (arxiv-get-pdf-add-bibtex-entry matched-arxiv-number arxiv_bib arxiv_pdf_loc))
#+end_src

This function utilizes the awesome [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][Org-ref]] library functions, such as =arxiv-get-pdf-add-bibtex-entry=. Given an Arxiv identifier, this function firsts constructs a bibtex entry with the paper metadata and stores it in =arxiv_bib=, which is a variable I had set to point to my centralized bib file. Then, the function downloads the pdf, renames the pdf to the bibtex key, and saves it in =arxiv_pdf_loc=, which is another variable I had defined which points to the directory where I want to save the pdfs.

We can add a Doom Emacs keybinding to quickly fetch the arxiv file. This allows me to call =SPC n a= from the Elfeed entry buffer.

#+begin_src elisp
(map! :leader
      :desc "arXiv paper to library" "n a" #'my/elfeed-entry-to-arxiv
      :desc "Elfeed" "n e" #'elfeed)
#+end_src

**** Update the bibtex file

The bibtex generated by the =arxiv-get-pdf-add-bibtex-entry= function lacks a =file= item pointing to the pdf file. We will see why this item is useful in the next section. Assuming we need to add the full path of the downloaded pdf, the =my/elfeed-entry-to-arxiv= function can be modified as follows:

#+begin_src elisp
(defun my/elfeed-entry-to-arxiv ()
    "Fetch an arXiv paper into the local library from the current elfeed entry.

- Update the bib entry with the pdf file location
"
    (interactive)
    (let* ((link (elfeed-entry-link elfeed-show-entry))
           (match-idx (string-match "arxiv.org/abs/\\([0-9.]*\\)" link))
           (matched-arxiv-number (match-string 1 link)))
      (when matched-arxiv-number
        (message "Going to arXiv: %s" matched-arxiv-number)
        (arxiv-get-pdf-add-bibtex-entry matched-arxiv-number arxiv_bib arxiv_pdf_loc)
        ;; Now, we are updating the most recent bib file with the pdf location
        (save-window-excursion

                (find-file arxiv_bib)
                ;; get to last line
                (goto-char (point-max))
                ;; get to the first line of bibtex
                (bibtex-beginning-of-entry)
                (let* ((entry (bibtex-parse-entry))
                        (key (cdr (assoc "=key=" entry)))
                        (pdf (org-ref-get-pdf-filename key)))
                        (message (concat "checking for key: " key))
                        (message (concat "value of pdf: " pdf))
                        (when (file-exists-p pdf)
                        (bibtex-set-field "file" pdf)
                        (save-buffer)
                        )))
        )
      )
  )

(setq org-ref-pdf-directory arxiv_pdf_loc)
#+end_src

What this function does is it opens the bibfile (=arxiv_bib=), navigates to the last line, then again navigates to the first line of the last bibtex entry to load the bibtex, and then fetches the pdf path. Then the function adds a =file= field to the bibtex with the pdf path using the function =bibtex-set-field=.

It is also important to set the path of =org-ref-pdf-directory= variable to the location of your pdf files, for org-ref to fetch the full path of the pdf properly using =org-ref-get-pdf-filename= function.

**** Tracking a reading list

Now I have the mechanisms in place to store the pdf and the bibtex entries of the papers I want to read after looking through the latest arxiv posts. This is a good time to setup a workflow to track my paper reading lists. I use Org-mode for this purpose.

Specifically, I create an Org file named =papers.org=, which has the following structure:

#+begin_src org
,#+STARTUP: content showstars indent
# Personal Paper readings
# Centralized location to track paper readings
,* Categorized [/]
:PROPERTIES:
:COOKIE_DATA: recursive todo
:END:
,** Some specific subfield
,* Maybe Read [/]
,* Know about it, would be nice to re-read [/]
,* Inbox
#+end_src

These are basically headings to file =TODO= items. I keep track of a paper to read using the Org =TODO= modes. For any new paper which I'm reading through Elfeed, I hit =SPC n e= to extract the bibtex and save the pdf in the centralized pdf directory. Now, I would want to file this paper automatically under =* Inbox= header as a =TODO= entry. To do that, we can modify the above function to read =papers.org=, go to the last element of the page (which points to the latest filed paper in =* Inbox=), and add a new entry with Org-ref citation.

#+begin_src elisp
(defun my/elfeed-entry-to-arxiv ()
    "Fetch an arXiv paper into the local library from the current elfeed entry.

           (match-idx (string-match "arxiv.org/abs/\\([0-9.]*\\)" link))
           (matched-arxiv-number (match-string 1 link))
           (last-arxiv-key "")
           (last-arxiv-title ""))

                (let* ((entry (bibtex-parse-entry))
                        (key (cdr (assoc "=key=" entry)))
                        (title (bibtex-completion-apa-get-value "title" entry))
                        (pdf (org-ref-get-pdf-filename key)))
                        (message (concat "checking for key: " key))
                        (message (concat "value of pdf: " pdf))
                        (when (file-exists-p pdf)
                        (bibtex-set-field "file" pdf)
                        (setq last-arxiv-key key)
                        (setq last-arxiv-title title)
                        (save-buffer)
                        )))
        ;; (message (concat "outside of save window, key: " last-arxiv-key))
        ;; Add a TODO entry with the cite key and title
        ;; This is a bit hacky solution as I don't know how to add the org entry programmatically
        (save-window-excursion
          (find-file (concat org-directory "papers.org"))
          (goto-char (point-max))
          (insert (format "** TODO Read paper (cite:%s) %s" last-arxiv-key last-arxiv-title))
          (save-buffer)
          )
        )
      )
  )
#+end_src

Thus we arrive at the final version of the =my/elfeed-entry-to-arxiv= function, which is now modified to keep track of the key of the paper using =last-arxiv-key= and title of the paper =last-arxiv-title=, so that we can construct a =TODO= entry to reflect the key and the title. The key is added in Org citation format.

[[file:images/paper_reading.png]]

I use [[https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex][helm-bibtex]] as my completion engine for bibtex, which shows me a menu when I =RET= on the citation key. Helm-bibtex allows me to see a contextual menu on any org link. I need to set the following variables so that helm-bibtex knows where to look for the pdf files:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq bibtex-completion-bibliography (list arxiv_bib))
(setq bibtex-completion-pdf-field "file")
#+end_src

[[file:images/paper_helm.png]]

Thus, using Org-mode to track my paper reading list helps me to store all my reading habits and notes within one file!

- I use the =* Inbox= header as a staging area whenever I store a paper from Elfeed.
- After I store the paper, I can re-file the paper in several categories as defined in =papers.org=, easily, using =C-c C-w=.
- I can read the paper directly in Emacs by =RET -> Open PDF -> RET=!
- The =[/]= is a TODO status indicator used in front of every header, which shows me the number of /read/ papers out of total number of papers in the sub-heading. Whenever I read the paper, I can just hit =RET= on the paper header to change the status to =DONE=, which automatically increases the count!
- I can directly use this org file to take notes under the header of each paper.

This workflow allows me to seamlessly fetch, read and take notes on papers, fully keyboard driven, directly inside one app!

[[file:images/paper_pdf.png]]

*** Syncing & Note taking in Ipad

Using the above method makes it trivial to sync my reading lists on my Apple Ipad. For starters, I keep the org files and bib files in my Dropbox directory, so any change in the =papers.org= file gets synced through Dropbox. I also add the arxiv pdf directory in my Dropbox, so that any new pdfs are automatically synced throughout my devices. On my Ipad, I use [[https://pdfexpert.com/][PDF Expert]] to read and annotate the papers by linking my Dropbox account. I take copious scribbles using my Apple pencil, and they are immediately synced so I can view the annotated pdf directly from my =papers.org= file.
*** Closing Thoughts

This is an evolving workflow, and it is probably not the most optimal one. However it works for me, and I can easily keep tweaking the config so that it supports any future requirements. Let me know if this worked for you in the comments, and I would love to hear any suggestions you might have so that I can make this workflow better! Thanks for reading!

:END:

In my [[/post/emacs_research_workflow/][last blog post]] I described a method I use to keep track of my paper reading habits, using Emacs. Using the workflow, I can now:

- Check the latest Arxiv papers using [[https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed][Elfeed]]
- Score the papers using [[https://github.com/sp1ff/elfeed-score][Elfeed-Score]]
- Save the papers in a local bib file, along with pdfs, using [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]] functions
- Maintain a paper reading tracker document in [[https://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]], where the workflow automatically adds the paper to read.

One crucial step I later realised which is missing from this workflow is the ability to store papers from my browser. Typically I do not read Elfeed /that/ religiously - my main source of papers always has been recommendations from colleagues, Twitter, conference acceptance lists etc. Thus, I need a setup where I can easily save an interesting paper I'm reading directly from the browser.

[[https://www.zotero.org/][Zotero]] is a great bibliography management software which allows you to do exactly that. After you install Zotero, you can install Zotero-connectors for the browser you use, and once you are in any PDF/journal/conference paper page, if you click the connector it automatically saves the file in your library, and downloads the pdf accordingly. With some extra plugins (Better Bibtex, Zutilo) you can also configure your setup such that once Zotero saves the PDF, it renames the file to proper naming conventions and moves the file to your desired location. Oh, also Zotero can be configured to automatically export a bibfile of your entire library, which you can load into Emacs using your favorite bibfile search library ([[https://rgoswami.me/posts/org-note-workflow/][Helm-bibtex]], [[https://emacsconf.org/2021/talks/research/][Citar]], [[https://irreal.org/blog/?p=5771][Zotxt]] etc)!

However, I have one major gripe in this workflow : this doesn't allow me to update my paper reading org file once Zotero saves the pdf! I thought about various ways to fix this, including writing a Python file to add a watcher on my bibfile, get the latest changed bib, add a line in my org file. The problem with this approach is that Zotero updates the bibfile after formatting and sorting, so to get the last updated bib entry I need to maintain a state of history of the file. Furthermore, for /any/ edits in the Zotero database, this watcher would run and add multiple lines of "Read paper X" in my paper reading list. There could be other easy ways to do this using Zotero, but I was out of ideas.

Plus, this post is not about Zotero, its about doing the same functionality in Emacs using existing libraries. How do we build a connector from browser? Also, I mostly read Arxiv papers anyway, so I would not need the power of 600+ Zotero translators written for various research paper sources, just the one for Arxiv. Enter [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.html][org-protocol]].

Org-Protocol is this wonderful library which allows Emacs to intercept calls from emacsclient. I got my initial motivation to use org-protocol from this cool package: [[https://github.com/mpedramfar/zotra][Zotra]]. What Zotra does is it runs the Zotero standalone [[https://github.com/zotero/translation-server/][translation server]], where the client can send an URL of a page containing a paper/PDF and get the formatted bibtex entry as output. One caveat of Zotra is that you need to run this external program via Docker on your machine, as running the standalone with =npm= [[https://github.com/zotero/translation-server/issues/139][rarely works]]. Another caveat is that this translation server will return the bibtex entry /without/ the PDF or link to PDF file in local, which is crucial for me to read the paper offline and through Helm-bibtex (checkout my last blog post). Having said that, Zotra gave me the idea to use org-protocol in the first place, for which I'm glad I stumbled into it!

Configuring Org-Protocol is easy. First, you need to let org-protocol know what to run when it /encounters/ a protocol. For that, you need to add an entry to the =org-protocol-protocol-alist= :

#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'org-protocol-protocol-alist
             '("arxiv-protocol"
               :protocol "arxiv"
               :function arxiv-protocol))
#+end_src

How does org-protocol gets triggered in the first place? Open your browser and add the following bookmark (also known as bookmarklet), and name it as "Save PDF":

#+begin_src html
javascript:location.href=('org-protocol://arxiv?url=%27+%20encodeURIComponent(location.href)).replace(/%27/gi,%22%27%22)
#+end_src

If you click this bookmark link on any page, then it would popup a message : "Open in Emacs?". What it does behind the scenes is that it runs a systemwide call in the =org-protocol= protocol, which is intercepted by emacsclient. Then, we define a /sub-protocol/ named =arxiv=, which is used in the =location.href= bookmark, which uses a parameter =url=, where the current page url is encoded. Once you click OK to open the link in Emacs (set this to never ask you again in future), org-protocol now looks at the list =org-protocol-protocol-alist= to find whose =:protocol= matches the sub-protocol used in the call, and runs its corresponding =:function=.

Now, all we need to do is to define a function which:

1. Inputs an Arxiv link (could be the PDF link or the Abstract link)
2. Fetches the PDF and bibtex from Arxiv
3. Stores the PDF into a predestined location, and adds the bibtex in my main bibfile
4. Add a note about this paper to read in my paper tracker org file.

We are in luck! In my [[/post/emacs_research_workflow/][last blog post]], I wrote functions to do 2-4! Re-using the function again here:

#+begin_src elisp
;; Save arxiv pdf to local and maintain a bibfile for the newly added paper, and update papers.org
(defun my/save-arxiv-to-local-db (matched-arxiv-number)
    "Save arxiv paper in local db

           (last-arxiv-title ""))
        (arxiv-get-pdf-add-bibtex-entry matched-arxiv-number arxiv_bib arxiv_pdf_loc)
        ;; Now, we are updating the most recent bib file with the pdf location

                ;; get to last line
                (goto-char (point-max))
                ;; get to the first line of bibtex
                (bibtex-beginning-of-entry)
                (let* ((entry (bibtex-parse-entry))
                        (key (cdr (assoc "=key=" entry)))
                        (title (bibtex-completion-apa-get-value "title" entry))
                        (pdf (org-ref-get-pdf-filename key)))
                        (message (concat "checking for key: " key))
                        (message (concat "value of pdf: " pdf))
                        (when (file-exists-p pdf)
                        (bibtex-set-field "file" pdf)
                        (setq last-arxiv-key key)
                        (setq last-arxiv-title title)
                        (save-buffer)
                        )))
        ;; (message (concat "outside of save window, key: " last-arxiv-key))
        ;; Add a TODO entry with the cite key and title
        ;; This is a bit hacky solution as I don't know how to add the org entry programmatically
        (save-window-excursion
          (find-file (concat org-directory "papers.org"))
          (goto-char (point-max))
          (insert (format "** TODO Read paper (cite:%s) %s" last-arxiv-key last-arxiv-title))
          (save-buffer)
          ))
  )
#+end_src

All this function needs is the arxiv number of a given paper, which is typically in the format of =xxxx.xxxxx=. Then, using the mighty [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]], this function fetches the pdf from Arxiv, gets a bibtex entry, writes the entry in my local bibfile, and adds a "TODO Read paper" entry in my paper tracker.

Thus, I need to extract this arxiv number from a given URL. I now define the =arxiv-protocol= function which org-protocol expects to trigger:

#+begin_src elisp
(defun arxiv-protocol (info)
  (let ((url (plist-get info :url)))
    (message (format "Arxiv received: `%s'" url))
    (let* ((match-idx (string-match "arxiv.org/.../\\([0-9.]*\\)" url))
        (matched-arxiv-number (string-remove-suffix "." (match-string 1 url))))
        (message (format "Extracted Arxiv number: `%s'" matched-arxiv-number))
        (when matched-arxiv-number
          (my/save-arxiv-to-local-db matched-arxiv-number)))
    nil))
#+end_src

This function does the following:
- From a given Arxiv URL (either abstract or PDF) perform a string match to extract the number
- For PDF links, this string match returns a number containing a trailing "=.=" (as our regexp expects =.= as well as numbers). Use =string-remote-suffix= to get rid of this trailing character.
- Call the function to extract and save the pdf!

[[file:images/org_protocol_arxiv_demo.gif]]

Thats it, you have now replicated Zotero connector functionality /without/ needing to have Zotero installed! It only works on Arxiv at the moment, but it is okay for now for me. In the future I'll investigate ways to get the entire Zotero translator functionalities directly in Emacs.

Thanks for reading!

*** Introduction

It has been three years since the release of [[/introducing-clutrr/][CLUTRR]], a benchmark we created to test the reasoning capabilities of modern neural networks. The idea is simple: can models understand first-order logic, in the backdrop of kinship relations? Specifically, we test the ability of the models to perform /implicit/ reasoning - figuring out the relation of two characters in a given story, where their relation is not provided explicitly. For example, consider the following story:

#+begin_quote
Linda and her sister Stacy disagreed about what to make for dinner. Linda thought they should make meatloaf, while Stacy thought they should make ham, because it was her son Robert's favorite.

Q: Linda is the _ of Robert.
#+end_quote

The correct answer of the above question is "aunt", which is not stated explicitly in the text. This is obvious because we can internally compute the following /composition/ of relations:

$A = \mathcal{R}(\text{Robert}, \text{Stacy}) \land \mathcal{R}(\text{Stacy}, \text{Linda})\$

where, $\mathcal{R}$ is the function to extract the relation, and we get the following /facts/: "Stacy is the /mother/ of Robert", and "Linda is the /sister/ of Stacy". Combining both, we get "Linda is the /aunt/ of Robert".

The use-case of CLUTRR is that we can test for arbitrarily large number of such combinations, and therefore test a models ability to do /length generalizaiton/ - testing its reasoning abilities in problems /longer/ or /shorter/ than the ones it has been trained. Theoretically, if a /systematic learner/ is exposed to all possible binary compositions of relations, it can extrapolate or interpolate with ease.

What we found back those many years ago, is that then neural models (LSTMs, RNNs, MACs, BERT) were unable to perform length generalization. Since then, there has been [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.06477][numerous]] [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00578][papers]] published which used CLUTRR to test the compositional generalization abilities of the models proposed, and improved the state-of-the-art significantly. However, length generalization still remains an [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.04901v2][elusive problem]] for modern neural networks, and a combination of factors are needed to make it work.

*** The issue with templates

Over the last several months, I have received feedback from the community that several data points in CLUTRR contain [[https://github.com/facebookresearch/clutrr/issues/15][glaring issues]] - they contain incorrect kinship-relation logic! For example, consider this data highlighted by Github user zhunyoung:

#+begin_quote
[Kathleen] was excited because she was meeting her father, [Henry], for lunch. [Howard] and his son [Wayne] went to look at cars. [Howard] ended up buying the Mustang. [Howard] likes to spend time with his aunt, [Kathleen], who was excellent at cooking chicken.

Q: Henry is the _ of Wayne. A: father
#+end_quote

As the zhunyoung correctly points out, this is incorrect as the answer should be /"great-grandfather"/ instead. Now the question is, how did the CLUTRR generator end up with this incorrect example, if it is built using the principles of first-order logic?

At its core, CLUTTR consists of entity-relation pairs which is built using a fixed set of [[https://github.com/koustuvsinha/glc/blob/386cfb036a37aa65d29c7dbde01f70f067f03890/rule_bases/clutrr_0.json][logical rules]]. By recursively applying these rules, arbitrarily complex chains of conjunction "paths" can be created. This entity-relation chain is then converted to semi-synthetic language by applying templated stories. The basic version only contains the template : =E2 is the {relation} of E1=, where =E1= and =E2= are the entities. Replacing the template with entity names, CLUTRR generates compositional puzzles of the following form:

#+begin_quote
Linda is the sister of Stacy. Robert is the son of Linda.

Q: Linda is the _ of Robert.
#+end_quote

However, it is clear this basic templating version would be easy enough for the models to reason on, as the input lacks complex natural language formulations, and sidesteps the problem of entity resolution, coreference resolution and relation extraction. Thus in CLUTRR, we collected a bunch of human-written stories to be the templates. These stories are written by Amazon Mechanical Turkers "turkers" when they are provided with a family relation tree (set of entities and relations between them). During generation of the data, we dynamically select these templates and stitch them together to construct the data (see our paper for more details).

Given the error pointed out by zhunyoung, it is likely that some of these human-written templates are incorrectly written. Digging a bit into the collected templates, surely I found the issue - the template used in zhunyoung's example is collected wrong:

#+begin_src json
{
  "template": "ENT_1_male and his son ENT_0_male went to look at cars. ENT_1_male ended up buying the Mustang.",
  "rel_comb": "son",
  "gender_comb": "male-male"
}
#+end_src

The way the data is defined, =rel_comb= states the explicit relationship between the two entities, such that we can fill in the blanks: "entity 2 is the =rel_comb= of entity 1". Clearly, in this example, =ENT_1_male= is not the =son= of =ENT_0_male=, rather he is the =father= of =ENT_0_male=. This is a case of /role-swapping/.

So what exactly happened here? During data collection, the turker must had exchanged the /order/ of the provided entities and written the story. If we swap =ENT_0_male= and =ENT_1_male= in the above example, the issue is fixed!

Interestingly though, none of the published papers on CLUTRR use this Amazon Mechanical Turk version of templates - they tend to use the basic templated version of the data. Now it is more clear why - the AMT data has issues we need to fix!

*** Searching the templates for issues

Now we have an idea of the type of issue that could be present in the data. The next step is the figure out /how many/ templates are affected by this. We have close to 5000 templates, so manually annotating them alone would take a lot of time for me. Thus, I opted for the second best option - writing a Python script to find the errors.

Turns out this is a hard problem - my script needs to run coreference resolution and then perform reliable /relation extraction/ from the collected templates. The problem is even more acute as we collected free-form stories - there is no fixed structure among the templates for easy extraction.

Nevertheless, my first attempt to build a simple pipeline involving a coreference resolver, and subsequent dependency tree extraction failed miserably. I use [[https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features][spacy]] and [[https://github.com/msg-systems/coreferee][coreferee]] libraries to extract the dependency tree and resolving coreferences. Comparing the predicted relations in the data, this method achieves a mere *34.6%* accuracy!

Surely the AMT templates are not /this/ bad! Time to invest in a better relation extraction pipeline.

Next, I turn to a state-of-the-art relation extractor to do its job. The [[https://github.com/thunlp/OpenNRE][OpenNRE project]] looked interesting - it is a neural model trained on NYT and Wikipedia datasets. The goal of this project is to perform /implicit/ [[https://aclanthology.org/D19-3029.pdf][relation extraction]], on multiple relation types. I ran the inference pipeline with =wiki80_bert_softmax= model on the CLUTRR train and test set. This also required a little bit of post-processing, as it always clubs the relations "son" and "daughter" to =child=, and "brother" and "sister" to =sibling=. This should extract the explicit relations easily, right?

Sadly, the relation extractor is only able to get ~30% of the labels correctly, which is even worse than my naive data extractor. Is the problem too complex, or the majority of templates has issues?

*** Relation extraction using zero-shot prompting

Over the last couple of weeks, [[https://chat.openai.com/chat][ChatGPT]] has taken the world by storm given how accurate its responses are! Surely it should be *much* better at extracting relations? I tested a couple of templates out:

[[file:images/chatgpt_clutrr_explicit.png]]

It is able to perfectly extract the explicit relation! Heck, it is even able to extract the implicit relation of /aunt/!

[[file:images/chatgpt_clutrr_implicit.png]]

It is too bad ChatGPT doesn't have an API to run the relation extractions /en-masse/. But it is clear some form of instruction-tuning would be able to extract the relations with a simple enough prompt. To test my hypothesis, I started with an openly available model - [[https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/flan-t5][FlanT5]] from [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.11416.pdf][Google]], which is conveniently available on Huggingface, along with multiple model scales. I used the =flan-t5-xl= model as it is the largest model which fits in my GPU without having to run inference on half precision [fn:fp16].

The results are quite good! =flan-t5-xl= gets *74.4%* and *71.6%* correct labels in the train and test splits! This is a more reasonable score, which basically says about 26-29% of the template is either incorrect or too hard for FlanT5 to reason correctly.

How about using a better model? [[https://beta.openai.com/][OpenAI]] recently released the instruction-finetuned version of [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165][GPT3]], =text-davinci-003=. GPT3 is a 175B parameter model, and this recent updated model is fine-tuned over a lot of instruction-oriented datasets so that is has good zero-shot and few-shot capabilities.

Turns out, it does get a little bit better than FlanT5: *77.97%* and *78.47%* on the train and test splits. This further reduces the error range to 21-22%, indicating the remaining templates needs to be analysed for potential annotation issues.

[fn:fp16] For some reason I'm getting way worse results on fp16 with FlanT5. Curious to know why that is the case.

*** Error analysis

Now, let us dig deeper into the errors, to find what kind of annotation errors are present in the templates. The CLUTRR AMT templates are three types: templates with two entities and one relation, templates with three entities and two relations, and templates with four entities with three relations. We first see the error % in these three buckets:

| Split | Relations | =flan-t5-xl= | =text-davinci-003= |
|-------+-----------+--------------+--------------------|
| Train |         1 |        89.92 |              91.36 |
|       |         2 |        84.86 |              79.76 |
|       |         3 |        57.63 |              68.72 |
| Test  |         1 |         87.5 |              89.74 |
|       |         2 |        83.89 |              85.57 |
|       |         3 |        55.41 |              68.01 |

Not surprisingly, templates with three relations are hardest for the model to extract relations, as the story is long and complicated. Interestingly, this is where GPT3 outperforms FlanT5 by a large margin. However, FlanT5 is able to get better performance in the train set for two relations (with three entities).

Now, to evaluate the errors, I first [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pn1pjLbEmqbaJqm5Ya81DEv7TnYRv3Wl9InbjlxiT2Y/edit?usp=sharing][manually annotate]] 127 templates of single relation templates where Flan T5 gets it incorrect. In these, I find only *23%* of templates having annotation errors. Of these, 75% of errors are due to the role swapping. Thus, a majority of the incorrectly classified templates are actually quite hard for the zero shot models to predict, while the rest of them can be either fixed by swapping the relations of the affected entities or dropping them altogether.

*** Releasing the GPT3 cleaned data: CLUTRR v1.3

I'm continually amazed at how far these large language models have progressed in the field, to the point they can perform complex tasks such as relation extraction with ease! Thanks to the instruction-tuned models GPT3 and FlanT5, I do not have to manually annotate thousands of data points. There is a slight possibility of false positives though, which would unfortunately require a full manual annotation with multiple annotators to verify. If you find an error with GPT3 annotated templates, feel free to open a PR to fix that! [fn:code]

I have been working to streamline the generation process for CLUTRR for a while ([[https://github.com/facebookresearch/clutrr/tree/develop][=develop=]] branch). To make the generation process faster, the graph generator is now maintained separately in [[https://github.com/koustuvsinha/glc][GLC]] repository, which is also used by another related project, [[https://github.com/facebookresearch/GraphLog][GraphLog]]. The changes in the AMT templates as described above are now released in [[https://github.com/facebookresearch/clutrr/tree/develop][version 1.3]], which adds the capability of choosing a subset of AMT templates for application. Additionally, if you wish to skip a specific template from the generation, you can set a flag in the configs during the generation process. I plan to merge the develop branch to main branch once we are ready for version 2.0.

*** Roadmap for CLUTRR 2.0

# CLUTRR is often mis-represented as a "dataset", but in reality it is a "dynamic diagnostic benchmark" which is supposed to be generated by the end user.
When we released CLUTRR we were just witnessing the power of large pre-trained models (BERT was released a few months prior). Now, the scenario in NLP has changed drastically with massive language models (GPT3, OPT) demonstrating a suprising ability - the ability to perform "zero-shot" reasoning and to learn "in-context", removing the need to learn the model weights (fine-tuning) on a specific task. This paradigm-shift in training/evaluating models will be a core research area in the coming years, with a renewed focus on /reasoning/. GPT3/ChatGPT, with all its massive number of weights, are still [[https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html][poor]] on arithmetic and logical reasoning.

Thus, it is important to test a models ability on logical reasoning, and also to perform compositional generalization on longer sequences (length generalization). Also, several exciting methods have emerged over the past year ([[https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903][chain-of-thought]] (CoT), [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.00114v1][scratchpads]]) which allow the model to perform better reasoning by providing /explanations/. CLUTRR is well positioned to test these, as CLUTRR v1.3 already supports the generation of intermediate proof steps, which can be useful with these methods to evaluate/train LLMs to perform logical reasoning. In the next major release, CLUTRR 2.0, we would be explicitly developing benchmarks and methods focusing on these areas. [fn:p1] If you would like to be involved or chat more about the possibilities of CLUTRR 2.0, feel free to drop me a mail!

[fn:p1] While drafting this blog post I came across this very [[https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08686][relevant preprint]], which shows in CLUTRR CoT can be outperformed handsomely by equivalent neuro-symbolic prompting methods.
