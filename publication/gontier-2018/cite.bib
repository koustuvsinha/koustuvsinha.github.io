 abstract = {Current conversational systems can follow simple commands
and answer basic questions, but they have difficulty
maintaining coherent and open-ended conversations about
specific topics. Competitions like the Conversational
Intelligence (ConvAI) challenge are being organized to push
the research development towards that goal. This article
presents in detail the RLLChatbot that participated in the
2017 ConvAI challenge. The goal of this research is to better
understand how current deep learning and reinforcement
learning tools can be used to build a robust yet flexible open
domain conversational agent. We provide a thorough description
of how a dialog system can be built and trained from mostly
public-domain datasets using an ensemble model. The first
contribution of this work is a detailed description and
analysis of different text generation models in addition to
novel message ranking and selection methods. Moreover, a new
open-source conversational dataset is presented. Training on
this data significantly improves the Recall@k score of the
ranking and selection mechanisms compared to our baseline
model responsible for selecting the message returned at each
interaction. },
