 abstract = {This report documents ideas for improving the field of
machine learning, which arose from discussions at the ML
Retrospectives workshop at NeurIPS 2019. The goal of the
report is to disseminate these ideas more broadly, and in turn
encourage continuing discussion about how the field could
improve along these axes. We focus on topics that were most
discussed at the workshop: incentives for encouraging
alternate forms of scholarship, re-structuring the review
process, participation from academia and industry, and how we
might better train computer scientists as scientists.},
