My primary research interests are Generative Language Modeling (Dialog Systems) and Neural Reasoning in Language. I am highly interested in exploring strong linguistic and logical priors in designing machine learning systems for text generation and representation.

Currently, I live in the wonderful city of [Montreal](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/canada/montreal), Canada, being a PhD candidate at [McGill University](http://mcgill.ca/) in the [School of Computer Science](http://cs.mcgill.ca). I am also a Research PhD intern at [Facebook AI Research (FAIR)](https://research.fb.com/), Montreal. Previously, I worked at [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](http://iitk.ac.in) at the position of Senior Project Associate, as well as [NRI Fintech](http://www.nrifintech.com/), Kolkata, as Front End Developer. You can find my detailed [CV here](assets/files/cv.pdf)
