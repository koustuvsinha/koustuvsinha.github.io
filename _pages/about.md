My current research interest involves investigating the limits of [systematic](https://slideslive.com/38922304/from-system-1-deep-learning-to-system-2-deep-learning) language understanding of modern neural language representation systems, by leveraging linguistic and logical priors. In particular, I investigate how language is represented by neural models in a human-like way by testing their ability to understand the semantics, syntax and generalizability in the context of natural and artificial languages. I am also interested in improving the state of Generative Language Modeling (Dialog Systems).

Currently, I live in the wonderful city of [Montreal](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/canada/montreal), Canada, being a PhD candidate at [McGill University](http://mcgill.ca/) in the [School of Computer Science](http://cs.mcgill.ca), supervised by [Joelle Pineau](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/). Previously, I was a PhD Research Associate at [Facebook AI Research (FAIR)](https://research.fb.com/), Montreal.

I am an associate editor of [ReScience C](http://rescience.github.io/), a peer reviewed journal promoting reproducible research, and I am the lead organizer of the annual Machine Learning Reproducibility Challenge ([V1](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ICLR2018-ReproducibilityChallenge.html), [V2](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ICLR2019-ReproducibilityChallenge.html),[V3](https://reproducibility-challenge.github.io/neurips2019/), [V4](https://paperswithcode.com/rc2020), [V5](https://paperswithcode.com/rc2021)). My work has been covered by several news outlets in the past, including [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03895-5), [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/2021/01/15/facebook-claims-its-ai-can-anticipate-covid-19-outcomes-using-x-rays/), [InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/news/2021/03/facebook-covid-prognosis/), [DailyMail](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-9153415/Facebook-claims-AI-predict-four-coronavirus-patients-condition-deteriorate.html) and [Hindustan Times](https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tech/news/facebook-wants-to-help-doctors-fight-covid-19-with-ai-and-xrays-71611044405211.html).
