My primary research interests are Generative Language Modeling and Dialog Systems. I am also interested in other areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) as well such as Text classification, Text representation, entailment and Logical Reasoning. I am also interested in exploring strong linguistic priors in designing machine learning systems for text generation and representation.

Currently, I live in the wonderful city of [Montreal](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/canada/montreal), Canada, working as a Research Associate in [McGill University](http://mcgill.ca/), while pursuing Masters at the [School of Computer Science](http://cs.mcgill.ca). Previously, I worked at [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](http://iitk.ac.in) at the position of Senior Project Associate, as well as [NRI Fintech](http://www.nrifintech.com/), Kolkata, as Front End Developer. I graduated B.Tech in Computer Science &amp; Engineering from [Institute of Engineering &amp; Management, Kolkata](http://iem.edu.in) in 2014. You can find my detailed [CV here](assets/files/cv.pdf)
