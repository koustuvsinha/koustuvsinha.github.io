My research interests lies in the intersection of Generative Language Modeling (Dialog Systems)and Neural Reasoning in Discrete domain (language and graphs). I am also highly interested in exploring linguistic and logical priors in designing machine learning systems which are robust and [systematic](https://slideslive.com/38922304/from-system-1-deep-learning-to-system-2-deep-learning).

Currently, I live in the wonderful city of [Montreal](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/canada/montreal), Canada, being a PhD candidate at [McGill University](http://mcgill.ca/) in the [School of Computer Science](http://cs.mcgill.ca), supervised by [Joelle Pineau](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/) and [William L. Hamilton](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/). I am also a Research PhD intern at [Facebook AI Research (FAIR)](https://research.fb.com/), Montreal. Previously, I worked at [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](http://iitk.ac.in) at the position of Senior Project Associate, as well as [NRI Fintech](http://www.nrifintech.com/), Kolkata, as Front End Developer. You can find my detailed [CV here](assets/files/cv.pdf)
