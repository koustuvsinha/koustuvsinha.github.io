My current research interest involves investigating the limits of [systematic](https://slideslive.com/38922304/from-system-1-deep-learning-to-system-2-deep-learning) language understanding of modern neural language representation systems, by leveraging linguistic and logical priors. In particular, I investigate how language is represented by neural models in a human-like way by testing their ability to understand the semantics, syntax and generalizability in the context of natural and artificial languages. I am also interested in improving the state of Generative Language Modeling (Dialog Systems).

Currently, I live in the wonderful city of [Montreal](https://www.lonelyplanet.com/canada/montreal), Canada, being a PhD candidate at [McGill University](http://mcgill.ca/) in the [School of Computer Science](http://cs.mcgill.ca), supervised by [Joelle Pineau](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/). I am also a Research PhD intern at [Facebook AI Research (FAIR)](https://research.fb.com/), Montreal.
I am an associate editor of [ReScience C](http://rescience.github.io/), a peer reviewed journal promoting reproducible research, and I co-organize the annual Machine Learning Reproducibility Challenge ([V1](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ICLR2018-ReproducibilityChallenge.html), [V2](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jpineau/ICLR2019-ReproducibilityChallenge.html),[V3](https://reproducibility-challenge.github.io/neurips2019/), [V4](https://paperswithcode.com/rc2020), [V5](https://paperswithcode.com/rc2020)).

Previously, I worked at [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](http://iitk.ac.in) at the position of Senior Project Associate, as well as [NRI Fintech](http://www.nrifintech.com/), Kolkata, as Front End Developer. You can find my detailed [CV here](assets/files/cv.pdf)
